# Research Data Analysis [![Yang](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/superyang713)
> data collected from a custom instrument at MIT Surface Science Lab.

Repository is for the purposes of lab data organizing, cleaning, processing and
visualization. Jupyter Notebooks are the main panels for data interaction and
presentation, whereas all the py files in the "lib" folder contain algorithms
that work behind the scene. 

This python library can process data collected from various surface science
instruments, including Mass Spectrometry (MS), Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy
(EELS), and Auger Electron Sepctroscopy (AES). It can also be used to calculate
the coverage of Au deposited on Ni single crystal, based on AES spectrum.

## Requirements

- lmfit package needs to version 0.9.10. The Gaussian model is changed in their
  recent update.
- Jupyter Notebooks are mainly just work spaces that are used to call APIs from
  the library. The format of these notebooks are by no means fixed.

## Examples

- Mass Spec:
- EELS:
- TDS: 
- CIRD:

## Contribute

Contributions are always welcome! The source code can also be modified to fit
other needs. For example, the method to calculate Au thickness with AES can also
be applied to X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) as well.
